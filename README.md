### This project was born out of the Excel LEFT, RIGHT, MID, VLOOKUP and CONCACT functions

So I stumble upon this Excel Tutorial Video from FreeCodeCamp [Microsoft Excel Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl0H-qTclOg&t=57s) and the Car Inventory Project caught my attention to replicate that using the Python on Jupyter Notebook.

A very big shout out 	:raised_hands: to my great mentor  [Shad Sluiter](https://github.com/shadsluiter) :man_teacher:
